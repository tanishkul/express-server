# **MERN STACK**
The **MERN** stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React / Redux, and Node.js. Given the popularity of React on the frontend and of Node.js on the backend, the MERN stack is one of the most popular full stack of technologies for building a modern single-page app. It is usually considered as an alternative to [MEAN stack development](http://mean.io/). Below is the architecture of MERN:

* **_MongoDB_** - Database layer
* **_Express_** - Middleware for Nodejs
* **_React_**- front end (User Interface)
* **_Node.js_** - web server logic

## 1. **MongoDB as a NoSQL database** :
* An open source document database that provides persistence for application data.
* Bridges the gap between key-value stores (fast and scalable) and relational databases (rich functionality).
* Stores data as JSON documents in collections with dynamic schemas.
* Designed with scalability and developer agility in mind.
* Designed to be used asynchronously thus it pairs well with Node.js applications.

Mongo DB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a No SQL database program, Mongo DB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. Mongo DB is developed by Mongo DB Inc., and is published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

## 2. **Express web framework of Node.js provides routing and middleware**
* Basically runs the backend code as a module within the Node.js environment.
* Handles the routing of requests to the right parts of your app.

Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack, together with Mongo DB database and AngularJS frontend framework.

## 3. **React.js provides a dynamic frontend**
* A JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build interactive / reactive interfaces.

React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

 

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

 

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

## 4. **Node.js on the server**
* A javascript runtime environment.
* An asynchronous event-driven engine - which means the app makes a request for some data and then performs other tasks while waiting for a response.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

 

Many companies and developers still use the MEAN stack, which is identical to the MERN stack except it uses AngularJS or Angular instead of React for the frontend. One of the distinguishing features from React is the virtual DOM manipulation, which helps keep apps dynamic and fast.
