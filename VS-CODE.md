# **VISUAL STUDIO CODE**
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

Visual Studio Code is based on [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)), a framework which is used to deploy [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) applications for the desktop running on the [Blink layout engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)). Although it uses the Electron framework, the software does not use Atom and instead employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in [Visual Studio Team Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio#Azure_DevOps) (formerly called Visual Studio Online).

In the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 2018 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool, with 34.9% of 75,398 respondents claiming to use it.
